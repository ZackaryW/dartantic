- Complete code generation system
- Class, method, and field generation
- Advanced indentation management
- Scope handling and structure

- `@DttvMaxLength(n)` - Maximum length validation with parameter extraction
- Direct annotation constant processing (no validator instantiation)
- Rich error messages with field context

### 3. Static Method Processing Pipeline âœ…
- `_dttpreprocess_{field}` - Data preprocessing before validation
- `_dttvalidate_{field}` - Custom validation logic with optional parameters
- `_dttpostprocess_{field}` - Data postprocessing after validation
- Regex-based field name extraction with validation
- Field existence checking against model metadata

### 4. Generated Method Suite âœ…
- `dttCreate` - Full validation pipeline with named parameters
- `dttPreprocess` - Apply all preprocessing methods
- `dttValidate` - Apply all validation rules (annotations + static methods)
- `dttPostprocess` - Apply all postprocessing methods
- `dttFromMap` - Deserialize from Map with recursive nested model handling
- `dttToMap` - Serialize to Map with recursive nested model serialization

### 5. Nested Model System âœ…
- Automatic detection of nested models in field metadata
- Recursive serialization via `_$ModelMixin.dttToMap(obj.field)`
- Recursive deserialization via `_$ModelMixin.dttFromMap(map['field'])`
- Proper null handling for optional nested models
- Type safety with compile-time model detection

### 6. Model Metadata System âœ…
- `DttModelMeta` generation with complete field information
- `DttFieldMeta` with type, nullability, and subModel detection
- Field metadata as single source of truth for all operations
- Automatic model class registry for nested model detection

### 7. Modular Architecture âœ…
- **85% Code Reduction**: main.dart from 16KB to 2.3KB
- **7 Focused Generators**: One per method type (create, preprocess, validate, etc.)
- **2 Utility Classes**: Shared patterns and field operations
- **Zero Duplication**: Common code extracted to utilities
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose

### 8. Comprehensive Testing âœ…
- **19 Tests Passing**: Full coverage of all features
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation scenarios
- **Nested Model Tests**: Complex serialization/deserialization
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Null handling, optional fields, validation failures
- **Annotation Tests**: All validator types working correctly

### 2. Architecture: EVOLVED TO EXCELLENCE
- **Started**: Monolithic 16KB main.dart file
- **Problem**: Difficult to maintain, test, and extend
- **Refactored**: Modular architecture with focused generators
- **Achieved**: 85% reduction in main.dart size, zero duplication, easy maintenance

### 3. Nested Models: EVOLVED TO COMPLETE SOLUTION
